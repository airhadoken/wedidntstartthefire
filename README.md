# We Didn't Start It Twitter Bot

This bot is set up to do the following:

1. Periodically query Google Trends for "Hot items"
2. Process those trends to determine their syllable structure and what they'd rhyme with
3. Construct those processed trends into new lyrics to "We Didn't Start the Fire"
4. Tweet the results

The source code is here in this repository, so you can build your own clones, submit pull requests, and learn from it to build your own rhyming engines and Twitter things!
